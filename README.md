# Active Object Localization
This repository represents the final project of [Reinforcement Learning Course](http://files.skoltech.ru/data/edu/syllabuses/2021/MA060422.pdf?v=xj03xr) from [Skoltech University](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/). It tackles a non-RL problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Frankly speaking, we would like to thank [Rayan Samy](https://github.com/rayansamy/) for being our consultant as this project is inspired by [his repository](https://github.com/rayansamy/Active-Object-Localization-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning).
